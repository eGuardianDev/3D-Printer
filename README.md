# The idea
#### I will try to create a 3D printer with diffrent modules that will allow it to 3d print / cnc cut / make pcbs and other things.
#### You can check the progress below

## Current state
#### I'm working on the driver for the stepper motor /It's almost done/. Back end and front end are currently under development.


## To do:
- [ ] Build the driver
- [ ] Build main movement and test it
- [ ] Build second driver
- [ ] Add first G-code implementations
- [ ] Add Marker and test some G-code

=====
- [ ] Build 3d Axis
 - [ ] Build driver
 - [ ] Build hardware
 - [ ] Add bed
- [ ] Build the modules
 - [ ] Make the first module (Pen module)
 - [ ] Make the second module (3D-printing module)
 - [ ] Make the third module (C.N.C module)
-[ ] Back end
 - [ ] Implement more G-Code
 - [ ] Add file upload
-[ ] Front end
 - [ ] Add uploading files
 - [ ] add camera
