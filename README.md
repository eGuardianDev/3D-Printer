# The idea
#### I will try to create a 3D printer with diffrent modules that will allow it to 3d print / cnc cut / make pcbs and other things.
#### You can check the progress below

## Current state
#### I'm working on the driver for the stepper motor /It's almost done/. Back end and front end are currently under development.


## To do:
====
Phase one -> 2D implementation
- [X] Build first driver
- [X] Test first driver
- [ ] Implement server logic
- [X] Build second driver
- [X] Test second driver
- [ ] Add first G-code implementations
- [ ] Add drawing sharpie and test some G-code

====
Phase two -> 3D axis implementations
- [ ] Build 3d Axis
  - [ ] Build driver
  - [X] Build hardware
  - [ ] Add bed

====
Phase three -> Building modules
- [ ] Build the modules
  - [X] Make the first module (Pen module)
  - [ ] Make the second module (3D-printing module)
  - [ ] Make the third module (C.N.C module)

====
Phase four -> User experience
- [ ] Back end
  - [ ] Implement more G-Code
  - [ ] Add file upload
- [ ] Front end
  - [ ] Add uploading files
  - [ ] add camera
